# Cisco IPv6 Troubleshooting - Lab 1

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- Your Network Consulting Firm is implementing an IPv6 Network Design for a large Internet Service Provider. One of your junior level technicians has come to you for help. He is having problems bringing up the OSPFv3 Adjacency between R2 and R1.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R2 and R1 form an OSPFv3 neighbor adjacency

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After connectivity was restored between R2 and R1 you realize that there is another problem, the OSPFv3 adjacency between R1 and R3 is not coming up as well. 

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R1 and R3 form an OSPFv3 neighbor adjacency.
- Once the neighbor relationship is restored, you should be able to ping from R2’s loopback 0 interface (2001:2:2:2::2) to R3’s loopback 0 interface (2001:3:3:3::3) with 100% Success.
- Do not remove any commands from any Router to complete this task.
